\b0 \cf0 \
The following concurrent program uses a variation of the 
\f1\fs26 WorkerQueue
\f0\fs32  class that was discussed in one of the lectures. Reverse engineer the program into a UML class diagram. Include the 
\f1\fs26 DisplayQueueTester
\f0\fs32  class, even though it just contains the 
\f1\fs26 main()
\f0\fs32  method that creates the active and passive objects. Show the relationships between the classes (i.e., generalization, association, aggregation, composition). Also produce a UML collaboration diagram for each active object, and at least one UCM of the system.\

\f1\fs26 import java.util.*;\

 * to ask the WorkerThread to terminate gracefully, regardless of\

\b \cf0 Notes on UML Class Diagrams\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf0 Include all the classes in your class diagram, and show the relationships between them; i.e., generalization, association, aggregation, composition. Your class icons should indicate the class' attributes and operations; i.e., they should have an attributes compartment and an operations compartment. Indicate which operations have sequential, guarded or concurrent synchronization semantics by labelling them with the corresponding synchronization property (even if it is the default). Feel free to use UML notes to explain any concurrency, mutual exclusion, or condition synchronization aspects of the Java programs that are not adequately modeled by the UML notation for classes and associations. But, remember that a UML diagram is supposed to abstract away from the source code, and not be a literal picture of a program. For example, local variables in methods are not drawn in a UML diagram.
\b \
Reminder\

\b0 The TAs will mark your assignments in the lab environment. It is your responsibility to ensure that any software required for viewing your files is also present in the lab.

Submitting Assignments\

\b0 Assignments are to be submitted electronically using the assignment \'93submit\'94 program. Emailed submissions will not be accepted. See the course outline for the procedure to follow if illness causes you to miss the deadline.\

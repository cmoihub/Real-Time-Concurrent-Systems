\b0\fs32 \cf0 Select an article or articles (newspaper, magazine, web, book chapter, etc.) on a topic related to the course. Real-time concurrent systems is a very broad subject, so pick something that interests you, and preferably something recent. Subject areas from previous terms included automotive design progress (self-driving cars, collisions avoidance systems, etc.), aerospace and aircraft evolution (Mars Rover, radar, drones), real-time system issues (Heartbleed bug, SIM heist, medical hacking, patriot missile failure), real-time system developments (garbage collection, RTOS, real-time databases), and advances in concurrency (multi-threading, hyper-threading, designing systems for concurrency, thread issues). If you need assistance in choosing a topic, just ask.\

\b0\fs32 \cf0 Once your article has been approved, you are to write a summary of the article(s). Your summary (one single file: pdf or word) should be 4-5 pages in length (double-spaced). If you are able to relate your topic to anything discussed in the lectures, that is excellent, but not required. Be sure to put your name and student number on your submission, and include all the details of your resource(s) (author, title, URL or publisher, date) in a "References" section at the end of your summary.\
